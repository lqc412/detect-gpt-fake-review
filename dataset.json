        "Nice looking and not too hard to construct...but made out of very FLIMSY particleboard and CHEAP inferior material... the veneer was soooo thin that it is almost not there... there were many chinks and damaged surfaces in the top piece and the whole thing is just not good quality.",
        "This is a must have for any kitchen. I had my previous splatter screen for so long and one day the screen just fell out. I saw this 3-Pack and just had to have it. The product is lightweight, good quality, and protects very well. Also a good value.",
        "Love these bottles. I make my coffee in the morning and bring it with me to,work,and it stays hot! I use the smaller one to have cold water during the day. Beautiful and stylish and the best of all they are amazing! They don't sweat and do their job!!!",
        "This little guy works pretty well!  I've had it for around two years now and it has held up to daily use in my house.  I'd definitely recommend it.  This can opener has held up better than any of the models I've owned in the past."
